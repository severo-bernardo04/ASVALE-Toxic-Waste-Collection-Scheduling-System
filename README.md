# ASVALE Waste Delivery Scheduling System ♻️📦  
A complete scheduling platform used by ASVALE to manage delivery appointments for toxic waste packages.

## 📌 Overview
This system allows users to schedule deliveries of toxic waste packages based on ASVALE’s working hours and approved packaging types.  
Administrators can access dashboards, monthly statistics, and operational reports to support waste-management logistics.

## 📌 Project Status & Planned Features

This system was developed as part of an academic project. While the core scheduling and administrative features are implemented, several planned components were not completed:

### 🔄 Planned (but not implemented)
- **Distance-based calculation** using a geolocation API to determine delivery cost based on the user's address and ASVALE's location  
- **Automated pricing system** tied to package type, distance, and operational rules  
- **Online payments via Pix**, including transaction verification and payment status tracking  
- **Automatic confirmation flow**, validating payment and finalizing the scheduling process

These features were outlined during development but were not implemented due to the academic scope of the project. The repository remains available for reference and potential future expansion.
